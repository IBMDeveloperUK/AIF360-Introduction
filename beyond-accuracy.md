# Beyond Accuracy: Fairness in Machine Learning

Building accurate machine learning models is not always good enough, especially when predictions are used to make decisions that impact peoples lives. In addition, the fairness of a model becomes very important when decisions need be fully trusted.

This session will use practical examples to define and quantify the fairness of both data and models, exploring algorithms to detect bias and disparity in data, and mitigate bias in both data and models.

Follow along if you want to know more about the fairness concepts and how to explore bias in your own data and models. You will learn about bias definitions and algorithms and how to apply them by following along with a Python Jupyter notebook.

## Getting started

If you do not have a IBM Cloud account yet, start by following these instructions. Else go straight to this section to create a Watson Studio service.
