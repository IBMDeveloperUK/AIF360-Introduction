# Trusted AI

## Details

You can find material for workshops on Trusted AI here. Most workshops will be using a Jupyter notebook that you can either run on your own machine or in Watson Studio on the IBM Cloud. 

To go through the workshop material smoothly it will be easiest when we all use the same setup, especially as it will be harder to help you straight away when you might get stuck during virtual events. Of course feel free to use your own local machine when you are comfortable with setting up environments and installing missing packages.
